        body: |
          Email encryption is broken, with too many steps required for users to send and view emails. The result is a vulnerable system open to cyberattacks that costs individuals and companies billions of dollars each year.

          We want to secure every email by increasing the adoption of encryption. We do this by putting the user experience first, but not at the expense of security. We want to start with the healthcare industry, which is under attack by hackers who value the personal health information of patients.

          There’s a lot of challenges for any doctor who runs a private practice, from dealing with insurers for payment to making sure the printer has enough ink.

          But one of the biggest challenges is realizing the benefits technology provides in an ethical way. Even something as simple as sending an email comes with legal and ethical obligations that practices need to consider.

          That’s exactly what Katie McBride, Ph.D. did when she wanted to improve the efficiency of her communications with patients and other providers.

          In today’s world, email is an essential part of business. That doesn’t change even though an industry may be regulated like healthcare.

          Dr. Katherine Siamas understood that she could not let HIPAA regulations stand in the way of making sure she could get the most out of every part of her dermatology practice – including sending email. Although there were many vendors to choose from, Dr. Siamas chose Paubox because of its security and ease of use.

          To meet that challenge, they sought out encryption companies who could meet their business needs without compromising their user experience.
